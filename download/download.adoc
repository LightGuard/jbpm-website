== Final releases

=== Distribution zip

The jBPM distribution zip includes binaries, documentation, examples and sources.

* image:download.png[] *#{site.pom.latestFinal.distributionZip}[Download jBPM #{site.pom.latestFinal.version}]*
** link:releaseNotes/releaseNotes#{site.pom.latestFinal.releaseNotesVersion}.html[Release notes #{site.pom.latestFinal.releaseNotesVersion}]
** License: link:../code/license.html[ASL 2.0]
** Release date: +#{site.pom.latestFinal.releaseDate}+
** Download size: Large (over 90% is due to examples, data sets and documentation)

* Older community releases: Check http://download.jboss.org/drools/release/[the release archive].

* Red Hat subscription releases: Check http://www.jboss.com/downloads/[the product download site].

=== Maven, Gradle, Ivy or Buildr

The jBPM jars are also available in http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|org.jbpm[the central maven repository]
(and also in https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/index.html#nexus-search;gav\~org.jbpm\~\~\~\~[the JBoss maven repository]).

If you use Maven, just add a dependency in your +pom.xml+:

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.jbpm</groupId>
      <artifactId>jbpm-core</artifactId>
      <version>#{site.pom.latestFinal.version}</version>
    </dependency>
----

This is similar for Gradle, Ivy and Buildr.

== Non-Final releases

*Non-Final releases are the best way to test drive new features and API's
to provide feedback before we lock down the API with a Final release.*
We welcome that feedback on the link:../community/forum.html[forum], link:../community/chat.html[chat]
or link:../code/issueTracker.html[issue tracker].

=== Alpha's, Beta's and CR's

An Alpha can be unstable.
A Beta should work (it passes automated testing), but its new API's might still change in the next release.
A CR should be almost identical to the Final release.

** link:releaseNotes/releaseNotes#{site.pom.latest.releaseNotesVersion}.html[Release notes #{site.pom.latest.releaseNotesVersion}]
** License: link:../code/license.html[ASL 2.0]
** Release date: +#{site.pom.latest.releaseDate}+

Or with Maven:

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.jbpm</groupId>
      <artifactId>jbpm-core</artifactId>
      <version>#{site.pom.latest.version}</version>
    </dependency>
----

=== Nightly snapshots

Nightly snapshots are unstable binaries, build by link:../code/continuousIntegration.html[our build server].
