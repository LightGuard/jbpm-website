== Get More Value out of BPM with BPSim Simulation

=== Thursday, April 10th, 11:00AM Eastern

Business process design with BPMN2 can be complex, with many feasible options for implementing a business strategy. How can process designers evaluate alternative approaches before committing to a costly rollout of an untried process design?

Recently, there have been great strides in new process simulation tools, intended to answer this question and help analysts optimize their process designs before any real data is available to test them against. The BPSim standard is now emerging to provide a common framework for defining and exchanging simulation data in conjunction with BPMN2 models.

Join http://bpm.com/[BPM.com]'s Nathaniel Palmer with guest Kris Verlaenen to learn how BPSim compatible tools can help you understand how business process designs will perform in practice, and where to look to improve and optimize them.

As part of the presentation we will see a live demonstration of Red Hat's new process simulation tool, included with JBoss BPM Suite. Attendees will also receive access to the developer version of BPM Suite, and the exclusive demonstration models used in the presentation.

*Why You Should Attend:*

* Learn How to Use Business Process Simulation for Data-Driven Process Excellence
* Gain Both Actionable Ideas and a Complete Working BPM Suite with Process Simulation Capabilities
* Jumpstart Your BPM Programs With Pre-built and Ready-to-Run Simulation Models

*Who Should Attend:*

* Business Architects and BPM Practitioners Looking to Get Started with Process Simulation
* Business Analysts Seeking to Leverage BPM and Simulation for Data-Driven Process Optimization
* Anyone Looking to Get Started with BPM, BPMN2 Process Modeling, or Process Simulation
