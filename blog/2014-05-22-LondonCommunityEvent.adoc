During next week a large percentage of the Drools team, some of the jBPM team and some community members will be meeting in London (Chiswick). There won’t be any presentations, we’ll just be in a room hacking, designing, exchanging ideas and planing. This is open to community members who wish to contribute towards Drools or jBPM, and want help with those contributions. This also includes people working on open source or academic projects that utilise Drools or jBPM. Email Mark (mproctor at codehaus d0t org) if you want to attend, our locations may very (but within chiswick) each day.

But we will be organising evenings things (like bowling) and could make Wed or Thu evening open to people wanting general chats and advice.
